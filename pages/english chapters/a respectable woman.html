          <p>
            The short story "A respectable woman" was written by an American writer Kate Chopin. Chopin has presented this beautiful story being based on the inner conflict that arises in Mrs. Baroda, one of the main character of this story.
            <br><br>The characters Gatson and Mrs. Baroda were husband and wife where Gouvernil was Gatson's buddy in this story. Gouvernil was invited to Gatson's house. Mrs. Baroda had heard too much about Gouvernil already but she'd never seen him. So she created a mental picture of Gouvernil as a tall person, slim body, wearing glasses and putting his hands in pocket which she totally disliked. But when she saw Gouvernil she got him totally desperate than her mental picture which she had created. As a result she felt in love and started to love him from her side at the first sight. On the one hand she started loving Gatson's friend Gouvernil but on the other hand she couldn't find any reasons why she loved him? and couldn't explain satisfactorily to herself. She could discover none of the characters or brilliant and promising traits upon Gouvernil that her husband possessed. On the contrary, Gouvernil sat rather mute and receptive before her. Gouvernil showed no eagerness upon hunting and he didn't care to fish too when Gatson proposed doing so. Though Gouvernil's  personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, she liked him. Days elapsed and elapsed but Gouvernil showed no interest upon Mrs. Baroda. So, she was not happy / satisfied for Gouvernil was doing. Being troubled she even questioned her husband when Gouvernil was going to leave their roof? One night she was sitting on a bench beneath a live oak tree at the edge of a gravel walk. She heard approaching steps but couldn't identify a person besides a red lighted cigar. Handling her a white scarf, Gouvernil notified Mr. Baroda that her husband told him to bring that scarf. By the way, in the meantime Mrs. Baroda wanted to reach her hand in the darkness and touch him with her sensitive tips of her finger upon Gouvernil's  face but being a respectable woman in society she herself controlled her emotions and went from there. Next morning she left her home for the city. She didn't arrive till Gouvernil was gone from her roof. After Gouvernil had gone she arrived at her home and as per her husband's proposal to invite Gouvernil in the upcoming summer which she opposed, she herself proposed to her husband to invite Gouvernil again. 
            <br><br>In this way, the story is  based upon the lesson that having faced many battles in life we should fight them alone with our own emotions controlling our negative emotions over positive emotions.

                <h4>d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda try to change Gouvernil's  and solitary habits?</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Mrs. Baroda tried to change Gouvernil's solitary habits for the reason that she wanted to make him talkative interesting and interactive. She did so by providing him a comfort situation, even she tried to provide him entertainment too.

      <h2>Reference to the Context</h2>
      <div class="dropdown">
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                <h4>a. What is the cause of conflict in Mrs Barodas mind? What role doen Mrs. Baroda, "being a respectable. woman play in the society? </h4>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>The cause of conflict in Mr. Baroda's  mind was the feeling of love towards her husband's friend Gouvernil.
                <br><br> 'Being a respectable woman' she controls her emotion of love which is crucial for saving her prestige, dignity, honour in society which was very significant in this context.
                
                <h4>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernil and contrast it with Gaston.</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Here in this story Gouvernil is described as shy charactered, uninteresting, not brilliant enough, not chatty enough, lacking positive and promising traits where as Gaston is described as chatty, interesting, brilliant and frank charactered person.
                
                <h4>c. Why does Mrs Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernil to her husband? </h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Mr. Baroda doesn't disclose her feelings towards Gouvernil to her husband because her husband himself is taken as society in the story. If she discloses her feelings then she will lose her dignity, honour, respect in the society. Also she could face problems if she does so. Hence, she doesn't want to violate society rule too. There can be misunderstanding between husband and society. Such a feeling is not digested in society.
                
                <h4>d. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how do you analyze Mrs. Baroda's attitude towards Gouvernil?</h4>

        <h2>Reference Beyond the Text</h2>
        <div class="dropdown">
          <div class="dropdown-content">
              <p><h4>a. The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and films. Narrate a story real or imaginative where an outsider’s arrival destroys the intimate relationship between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without direct fault of anyone. Anton’s Chekhov’s story ‘About Love’ is a story on this subject.</h4>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Anton Chekhov’s story “About Love” is an interesting story where the arrival of Alyohin in Mr Luganovich’s family destroys the intimate relationship between the husband and the wife and it causes terrible troubles and mental stress to his wife Anna Luganovich.<br><br>
                Mr Luganovich and Anna are husband-wife living together in the city. Though there is a wide gap of age differences between the husband and the wife, they are living happily. In fact, Anna is a young lady of about twenty-two. She is married to a judge, a man of over forty. She is a young woman, beautiful, kind, intelligent and fascinating. Her gaze, her beautiful and delicate hands, her way of walking, her voice, and her hairstyle are all impressive to anybody. As the story opens, she has a six month’s baby and later she has another baby. She has been living with her husband in peace and harmony. But the arrival of another man in her life damages her life entirely. Ultimately, she has a neurotic problem and she has to leave Alyohin. The same thing happens in the story “A Respectable Woman” with the arrival of Gouvernail in Baroda’s family. In the former story, Anna leaves the city for Crimea to feel relaxed and refreshed and here in this story, Mrs Baroda leaves the plantation for her Aunt Octavie’s so that she can get relaxed and refreshed from her mental stress.
                
                <h4>b. Mrs Baroda makes an expectation about Gouvernail even before meeting him. Suppose you are a mature girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure for getting married. Write in about 200 words describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Marriage is a lifetime decision. That’s why one should never rush to this stage until he/she is fully sure about life partner. Otherwise, it may be the folly of a lifetime. It is a serious matter of life. One should put a lot of thought into intellect before deciding to marry someone. It is not as same as judging a book by its cover as there are many pages, paragraphs, sentences, and words in it. I hope to see the following qualities in my future wife/husband:<br><br>
                • S/he has good manners to show his affection and care. <br>
                • S/he admits his shortcomings and accepts my follies (Good Listener). <br>
                • S/he enjoys my company and understands and respects my decision, too. <br>
                • S/he knows my likes and dislikes, my birthday, and remembers to give me little gifts and surprises on different occasions. <br>
                • S/he is sweet and has a good sense of humour. <br>
                • S/he never places restrictions on me or the relationship. <br>
                • S/he respects my family and friends and truly loves me. <br>
                • S/he can balance his work and family and face challenges. <br>
                • S/he is independent both financially and emotionally.
