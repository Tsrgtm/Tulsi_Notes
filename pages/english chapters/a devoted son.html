            It's a story based on the overall family activities of Mr. Verma. It's a story about Mr. Verma's family in the rural village of India. <br><br>
            The story's plot develops with the news that Rakesh topped the medical exam which made his father very much glad. 
            Being very happy and satisfied with his son's result Mr. Verma organized a party in house where well wishers were fed with delicious items, sweetmeats bettel-leaves, etc along with the best wishes of them to Rakesh slapping on his back.
            Then, Rakesh went to USA for further study. He worked there in famous of prestigious hospitals in USA. Rakesh as well as his family members were missing each other very much. Finally after some time, Rakesh returned to his hometown and married a simple but not well educated girl which was chosen by his mother. But his father was dissatisfied as he wanted his son to marry a well educated girl. Rakesh continued his task & worked in city hospital. He soon became a clinic owner too.

So, Rakesh himself being a doctor banned some sweet, spicy and oily food to his father and he forbade his wife to feed his father rich foods. Rakesh being a devoted son, every morning he used to read newspapers for his father, he used to take him in open space for fresh air. He used to serve him a cup of tea not in ordinary cup chinese but in a brass tumbler. Besides, all these carings Verma was always disappointed with his son's behaviour towards him. The only thing Verma was disappointed with was that he wasn't allowed to eat sweet and oily foods which he liked very much. He had his one old friend Vatia with whom he shares his personal experiences One day Mr. Verma bribed his grandson to buy him a jalebi for thirty paisa and he gave twenty paisa for him. But unfortunately the conspirator caught reed handed and Rakesh shouted at his father. Verma continued to hate his son but Rakesh took care of his father very much.

            <p>
                <h4>a. How did Verma couple make sacrifices for their son's higher education?</h4>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Verma couple made sacrifices for their son's higher education by doing hard labour in their entire lifetime. To achieve their dream of educating son, Verma worked hard for forty years in kerosene depot whereas his wife worked in household tasks.
                
                
                <h4>b. Mr. Varma suffers from diseases one after another after his wife's death. Would he have enjoyed better health if she had not died before him? Give reasons.</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Yes, he would have enjoyed better health if his wife had not died before him. Mr. Varma started to feel weak only after his wife's death. As he loses her, he found himself alone and suffered from depression. He started doing unusual activities. He felt broken into pieces.
                
                <h4>c. Dr. Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As he loves his father and worries about his weakening health, but as a doctor, he is strict on father's diet and medicine. In your view, what else could Rakesh have done to make his father's final years more comfortable?</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>In my opinion, Rakesh could have done the following things to make his father's final year more comfortable:<br><br>
                a. He could have treated his father more friendly instead of shouting at him. <br>
                b. He could have tried to understand his fathers feelings instead of becoming tensed about his health. <br>
                c. He could have provided his father with mental support. <br>
                d. He could have brought a bit of change in himself instead of changing his father. <br>
                e. He could have allowed only little sweet foods as his father's demand.
                
                
                
                <h4>d. What does story say about relationship between grandfather and grandson?</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>In some families we find bond relationships between grandparents and grandson. In this story too a relationship between grandfather and grandson is presented · From this relation we can assure that a person loves interest more than his principal. The grandson is one and only person with whom Verma spends most of the time. He starts to fulfill his desires through grandson. But, here we find that Verma is seeking benefits from an innocent child who know nothing about bribe.
                
                
                <h4>e. Do you call Rakesh a devoted son?</h4>
                
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>From Verma's point of view, Rakesh may not be a devoted son but from my point of view Rakesh is a devoted son. Caring his father, every morning he serves him a cup of tea, not in ordinary china glass but in Varma's favourite brass tumbler, he reads newspaper everyday, he manages him in the garden. Besides all these activities the main thing is that caring for his father's health he forbade some spices of foods. Also, he kept on serving his father though his father used to curse him through his thorny words.

              <p><h4>a. Write an essay on The Parents’ Ambition for their Children in Nepali Society. You must give at least five examples.</h4>

               <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Family refers to a wide network of extended relationships. Parents have great ambition for their children in Nepali Society. Most of the parents of the children are predetermined and preoccupied with the prejudices that their children to be the best person in the society such as the best doctor, the best engineer, the best teacher, and many more. Some instances provoke such ideas: <br><br>
               a. Due to parents’ ambition for their children, some children labour hard to achieve their destination and got succeed in the end.<br>
               b. Parents are the facilitator and guides who can lead their children to the right path of success and help them to obtain achievement in life.<br>
               c. Every parent wishes their child to become the brightest star in the group. In some cases, their pushing to their kids leads them to succeed and help them to be better in life.<br>
               d. Sometimes, parent’s determining the future of their children do not prove how good their parents are and it leads destruction of life as well. Thus, parents should listen to the voice and aim of their children as well for their better in future.<br>
               e. Anyway, the duty of parents is to stay close to their children, spend time together, play and relax which will provide them with a sense of security and build a positive bond for their future.
               
               
               <h4>b. Medicines replace our diets in old age. What can be done to make old ageless dependent on medicine?</h4>
               <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>Medicines replace our diets in old age. With age, the number of calories you need begins to decline. “As we get older, the body becomes less efficient at absorbing some key nutrients,” says Katherine Tucker. In addition, the ability to taste food declines, blunting appetite. Some foods become difficult to chew or digest. Thus, medicines become the best option to replace our diets in old age. To make old ageless dependent on medicine, they should do the following things:<br><br>
               
               a. Eat plenty of colourful fruits and vegetables such as fruits like pineapples, oranges and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkin, and sweet potatoes.<br>
               b. Eat cereals, bread, crackers, rice or pasta every day mostly high fibre varieties.<br> 
               c. Have low-fat or fat-free dairy (milk, or cheese) that are fortified with vitamin D to help keep your bones healthy.<br>
               d. Use of mustard oil or olive oil as a cooking medium as both prevent high cholesterol and improve good cholesterol in the blood.<br>
               e. Egg whites are a good source of protein to repair worn-out cells and tissues.<br>
               f. Vegetable soups without cream and thickening agents are a healthy meal to be taken as supper.<br>
               g. Drink about 10-15 glasses of water a day to prevent dehydration especially in summer.<br>
               h. Also, exercise regularly, stretch and do yoga to ensure absorption of nutrients well.<br>
               i. Balancing physical activity and a healthful diet is the best recipe for health and fitness.<br>
               j. Set a goal to be physically active for at least 30 minutes every day.</p>
