      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div class="dropdown">
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>"Neighbours" is a short story about false judgements which was written by Tim Winton. The story is based on the overall activities of newly married young couple who live in a multicultural and multilingual suburb.
                <br><br> The story has presented different visions with different behaviours. The main characters and young man young woman are unnamed in the story who had recently migrated to a new multicultural and multi lingual suburb in Australia which contains European emmigrants. They lived in a beautiful house with high ceiling and paned window which provided them an elegant feeling. The man worked on his thesis "The development of 20th century novel " and the young woman worked in hospital. The young man used to listen stories of eccentric patients as described by his wife. They were so cautious about their neighbours. They weren't happy rather they felt quite disturbed and irritated. They were disturbed by loud murdering noise of next door Mecedonian family. Also the Polish widower living next young couples house used to disturb them by hammering hails for whole day were without any purpose.<br><br> Slowly time elapsed, it took nearly 6 months for young couple to discover that Mecedonian family were talking with each other rather weren't murdering each other. The little boy was so disgusting. Once he was seen spraying a cat by young man. Neighbours also used to took their eyes over young couple that man was setting inside house  and woman was working in hospital.
                <br><br> In Autumn, young couples started to cultivate vegetables in their kitchen garden. In the mean time, the neighbours got chance to have a conversation with young couples providing them suggestions for mulching, healing, and spacing. Young man was still careful of the words. Even a woman with butcher's arm provided them a bag of garlic cloves. They had built a hen house but not finely which fell sooner. The Polish widower without invitation went there and rebuilt it.
                <br><br> By Winter young couples became familiar with neighbours. They learnt various things and started to share stories and walk with straight head. The young couple wanted their pregnancy to be kept within them only but when neighbours know about their pregnancy, they started to care young woman and started to provide presents. The man in Seli offered her chocolates and cigarettes: The Polish widower provided her a piece of bundle of woodscraps. An Italian woman offered name to the baby. Even a Greek woman after touching young woman's belly assured that the baby was boy. One of woman knitted baby's clothes also. Young man counted 12 faces in the fence waiting for good news. Young woman gave birth to a baby boy. The neighbours were cheering outside with happiness. Young man began to weep being emotional after he saw the incidents happening outside and his false judgement towards neighbours.
                <br><br> In this way his negative concepts changed better. Human relations and humanity all are beyond every aspects. Showing love and care can't become a barrier though there is linguistic and cultural difference.</p>

      <h2>Understanding the Text</h2>

            <p>
                <h4>a. Describe how the young couple's house looked like?</h4>
                
                The young couples had a small house which provided an elegant feeling as it had high ceilings and paned windows. The young man could see out over rooftops from his study window.
                
                <h4>b. How did the young couple identify their neighbours at the beginning of arrival?</h4>
                The young couple had a negative impact upon their neighbourhood at the beginning of their arrival. They felt quite irritated. The loud talk of the Mecedonian family, peering at the fence, continuous hitting of the nail by the Polish widower, urinating of the boy in the street make them feel imitated. In addition, the young man despised the neighbour's involvement with their gardening efforts.
                
                <h4>c. How elid neighbours help young couples in kitchen garden?</h4>
                Under a watchful eye of neighbours, young couples performed various Various activities. They also planted vegetables in the kitchen garden where they got their neighbours with different suggestions regarding healing, spacing and mulching. Also a big woman with a butcher's arm provided them with a bag of garlic cloves.
                
                <h4>d. Why were people in neighbourhood surprised at the role of young man and his wife in their family?</h4>
                
                The people in the neighbourhood raised their eyebrows at the role of young man's role and his wife in their family because mainly in family man works outside and female stays inside house but in young couple's family there is just opposite. Also, they used to wake up late.
                
                <h4>e. How did neighbours respond to woman's pregnancy?</h4>
                
                The neighbours smiled nonstop after they had known the fact about the young couple's pregnancy. The man in the deli gave her cholocates and cigarettes. The polish widower offered wood scraps. An Italian woman provided name for the boy and a Greek woman after touching the young woman's belly assured that the baby was a boy. The woman next door had knitted a cloth for the baby. In this way neighbours had a positive response to woman's pregnancy.
                
                <h4>f. Why did young man begin to weep at the end of story?</h4>
                
                The young man begins to weep at the end of  story because he realises his false judgements towards his neighbours after the baby boy was born. He got so emotionally attached that he begins to weep after realising the neighbour's efforts and help towards him.
                
                <h4>g. Why do you think the author didn't characterize the persons in the story with proper names?</h4>
                
                A person's name is both important and unimportant in a multi-cultural society. However, it's not much crucial because one's ethnic identity appears more important than one's name. The author might want to put narrative in general category that refers to similar events. Furthermore the author may wish to show ethnic identity is more important than individuality.

      <h2>Reference to the Context</h2>
      <div class="dropdown">
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                <h4>a. The story shows that linguistic and cultural barriers don't create any obstacles in human relationships. Cite the examples from story where the neighbours have transcended such barriers.</h4>

                Though, there are social, cultural and lingual diversities in the story, yet we can clearly see the sense of love and care between young couples and their neighbours. 
                <br><br> Besides cultural and lingual diversity in  that society, the young couple are able to cope with the situation. Though they don't have a conversation between them, gradually day by day their closeness increased and they became familiar. When the young couple started to plant vegetables in their kitchen garden the neighbours came to the fence and provided them suggestions. Also an unknown big woman with a butcher's arm offered them a bag of garlic cloves. We can find a sense of caring and love  during the time of young  woman's pregnancy. In this time too they are not close enough to each other. But their neighbours offered her chocolates, wood scraps, etc. Some of them assured that it was a boy and one of the women offered a name to the baby. The main incident that occurs to support the above given line is cheering of neighbours as the result of boy's birth. Thus, even the couple and neighbours didn't have a close relation at first, the neighbours provided love and care continuously to the couple which gets the main credit that proves linguistics and cultural barriers don't create any obstacles in human relationship.
                
                <h4>b. The last sentence of story reveals," The twentieth century novel hadn't prepared him for this. " In your view, what differences did the young man find between twentieth-century novels and human relations ? </h4>
                
                Although the couple had not planned for the pregnancy, the  young woman becomes pregnant and the neighbours become aware about it after a certain period of time. They are willing to assist and are courteous. All of them are delighted to have a baby and wish them well after the birth of child. For the young man, birth of a child is marvelous because of which he learns that 20th century novel had not prepared for him for this. In my view, the major differences that the man found between 20th century novels and human relations are unlike characters in novels, humans have to deal and overcome various startling situations and events in life. Everything doesn't go real as it does in novels. To overcome such situations, one must prepare himself in ways that novels can't teach.
                
                <h4>c. A Nepali proverb says, "Neighbours are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral procession." Does this proverb apply in the story? </h4>
                
                A Nepali proverb, "Neighbours are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral procession" is applied in the story.
                <br><br> In the story when the young couple started to plant vegetables in their kitchen garden the neighbours stood at the fence with their suggestions where the suggested young couple about spacing, healing and mulching. The Polish widower also rebuilt the hen house. Many neighbours supported young woman and even encouraged her during her pregnancy by providing chocolates, wood scrapes, etc. One of their neighbour offered baby's name .Even one of the women assured that the baby will be baby boy where they had helped the young a lot and also when the baby was born neighbours started to cry with joy and happiness which proves the given line to be a real one.
                
                <h4>d. The author deals with an issue of multiculturalism in the story. Why do you think multiculturalim has become a major issue in present world? </h4>
                
                Multiculturalism can be defined as the presence of diverse cultures in a society. It mainly  makes demographic make-up. I think multiculturation has become a major issue in the present world because along with making people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds together, it invites various social problems and high crime rates.
